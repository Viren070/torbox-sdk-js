  "description": "### Full documentation for TorBox  Current API Base: `https://api.torbox.app`  Current API Version: `v1`  You can find more API docs here: [http://api.torbox.app/docs](http://api.torbox.app/docs) (they aren't as great as these, but is in a format most people would be familiar to).  ### General Information  - You can rely on both `success` booleans or status codes to determine if a call was a success. Status code `200` always means a success. `403` means authentication error. `500` means something went wrong on TorBox's end. `400` means the user did something wrong, or an input wasn't correct, or expected.      - There will always be a user-friendly message in `detail` for a reason why a call was a failure, or a success message. You may forward these directly to users.      - The `/usenet` and the `/webdl` API endpoints are nearly the same as the `/torrents` API endpoints apart from some different named inputs and outputs.      - All outputs are JSON unless otherwise specified. Check out the examples to be sure.       ### Rate Limits  - Unless stated below, all endpoints are rate limited to **5/sec** per IP, no edge rate limiting.      - `POST` /torrents/createtorrent is rate limited to **50/hour** per IP and **10/min** at edge.      - `POST` /usenet/createusenetdownload is rate limited to **25/hour** per IP and **10/min** at edge.      - `POST` /webdl/createwebdownload is rate limited to **25/hour** per IP and **10/min** at edge.      - If you have a specific application, please contact us with your IP and reason to get unlimited requests.       ### Standard Response  ``` json {      success : boolean, // whether a response is successful or not      error : string, // an error code if there was an error, or null if success      detail : string, // a user-friendly message      data : any // usually an object/dict, but can be anything, check the examples }   ```  ### Errors Table  Errors codes are part of the standard response type. If the code ends in  ERROR , the error is the server's fault else that error is something that the client caused.  | **Error Code** | Error Meaning | | --- | --- | | DATABASE_ERROR | Could not access internal database/memory store information. | | UNKNOWN_ERROR | The reason for the error is unknown.

These are the API routes that are nearly the same with Real-Debrid API routes. You will have to change things such as parameters and check outputs as they both are not the same. You can find docs to Real-Debrid's API [here](https://api.real-debrid.com/).  | Real-Debrid API Routes | TorBox API Routes | | --- | --- | | `GET` /torrents | `GET` /torrents/mylist | | `GET` /torrents/info/{id} | `GET` /torrents/mylist?id={id} | | `GET` /torrents/instantAvailability/{hash} | `GET` /torrents/checkcached | | `PUT` /torrents/addTorrent | `POST` /torrents/createtorrent | | `POST` /torrents/addMagnet | `POST` /torrents/createtorrent | | `POST` /torrents/selectFiles/{id} | **None**, _not needed. Torrents will download all files. This will not be changed._ | | `DELETE` /torrents/delete/{id} | `POST` /torrents/controltorrent | | `POST` /unrestrict/link | `GET` /torrents/requestdl |  ### Dates  All dates returned from the API are normalized to UTC time. All dates are in the format:  `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`  Example: `2024-10-21T20:47:03Z` = The 21st of October, 2024 at 8:47:03 PM UTC.  This makes it easy for users and integrations to parse these dates and change them to the user's time zone for better UX. For more information on these formats, you can take a look at this [cheat sheet](https://strftime.org/).",
